h1. noword

A simple offline "textile" to HTML converter with syntax highlighting, and other goodies.

It's intended for generating course documents (I'm using it for teaching), but should generic enough for any purpose. 

The way it works is first to write a document in _textile_ format, and then run "noword.py" to generate the HTML document.

Still work in progress but current features:

* Syntax highlighting using Pygments
* Easy to generate text boxes
* Partially encrypted content using AES. It's useful to, say, put a solution to an exercise as part of the document, but it's only viewable when the key is entered
* Works as either standalone documents (opened using file:///) or using httpprotocol
* If http protocol is used, it's automatically using HTML5 "localStorage" to store the key which could successfully decrypt. Hence, no more key entry for when the document is reloaded or opened
* HTML5 offline mode for http protocol
* Fully extensible
